## 2. Problem Statement

African youth face three major challenges in accessing information:

1. Fragmented information sources  
   Important news and opportunities are scattered across multiple platforms.

2. Low trust and credibility  
   Fake news, clickbait headlines, and unverified sources reduce confidence in digital content.

3. Lack of local relevance  
   Most global platforms do not prioritize African or youth-specific content.

There is currently no unified system that delivers credible, youth-focused, and locally relevant information in an automated and scalable way.

---

## 3. Project Concept (High-Level)

VeriAfrica is a content aggregation and verification platform designed for African youth.

At a conceptual level, the platform:
- Collects information from trusted digital sources
- Filters and organizes content based on relevance and quality
- Stores cleaned content in a structured backend
- Delivers updated content automatically to users

The system prioritizes credibility, accessibility, and African relevance.

## 4. Core Content Categories (Abstracted)

Content is conceptually organized into three broad categories:

1. Serious / Informational Content  
   - Regional and global news  
   - Education, policy, and societal updates  

2. Youth & Engagement Content  
   - Entertainment  
   - Sports  
   - Culture and trends  

3. Local African Relevance  
   - Country-specific updates  
   - Youth opportunities and programs  
   - Events and initiatives  

Specific sources, ranking logic, and filtering rules are confidential.

## 5. How the System Works (Conceptual Flow)

At a high level:

1. Content is retrieved from verified digital sources  
2. Duplicate and low-quality content is filtered out  
3. Relevant information is categorized and stored  
4. Users receive updated content without manual posting  

The platform is designed to operate continuously and automatically.

This document intentionally excludes implementation details.
