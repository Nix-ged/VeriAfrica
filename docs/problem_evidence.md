## Social Media as a Major Driver

- **67% of Americans** have encountered fake news on social media
- **38%** admit to accidentally sharing fake news
- Viral false stories often outperform real news in engagement

Social platforms amplify speed over accuracy, allowing misinformation to spread
faster than verification.

## Trust Collapse in Media

- Only **32% of Americans** trust mass media
- Over **44% of global news consumers** do not trust traditional news sources
- Trust levels are even lower in some regions outside North America and Europe

This erosion of trust creates demand for independent verification systems.
